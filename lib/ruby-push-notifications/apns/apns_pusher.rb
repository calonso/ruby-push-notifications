    # This class coordinates the process of sending notifications.
    # It takes care of reopening closed APNSConnections and seeking back to
    # the failed notification to keep writing.
    #
    # Remember that APNS doesn't confirm successful notification, it just
    # notifies when one went wrong and closes the connection. Therefore, this
    # APNSPusher reconnects and rewinds the array until the notification that
    # Apple rejected.

    class APNSPusher

      # @param certificate [String]. The PEM encoded APNS certificate.
      # @param sandbox [Boolean]. Whether the certificate is an APNS sandbox or not.
      # @param options [Hash] optional. Options for APNSPusher. Currently supports:
      #   * host [String]: Hostname of the APNS environment. Defaults to the official APNS hostname.
      #   * connect_timeout [Integer]: Number of seconds to wait for the connection to open. Defaults to 30.
      #   * slice_quantity [Integer]: Number of notifications to send to avoid hard limits. Defaults to 5000.

      # Pushes the notifications.
      # Builds an array with all the binaries (one for each notification and receiver)
      # and pushes them sequentially to APNS monitoring the response.
      # If an error is received, the connection is reopened and the process
      # continues at the next notification after the failed one (pointed by the response error)
      #
      # For each notification assigns an array with the results of each submission.
      #
      # @param notifications [Array]. All the APNSNotifications to be sent.
